In that repositary I added All concept of OOPs Concept by individual folder 

Example:
*Brief Defination for all Tasks.

1)Abstract_Class :- When you want abstract opration then you shold import abc pakage So, In this program i have import abc Class and that class function like abstractmethod and ABC then i praform overriding operation with multiple inheritance

2)interface :- Interface not supported in python so I perform Multiple inheritance here.

3)Method Overriding :-  Here, I created two class with same fuction but when we call we calling by particular class instance.

4)Multilevel Inheritance :- In there I created three class(parent,child, grandchild) and inherit parent and child class in to grandchild class and by that we can access any class of functions.

5)Method Overloading :- Python not supporting overloading concept like other languges but we can preform by conditional statement as I written the code.
